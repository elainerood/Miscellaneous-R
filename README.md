# Miscellaneous R code
Random functions/code that isn't (yet?) part of a larger project. Updated as I come up with things.

Contents (mostly chonological):
* **draw_cards.R** and **draw_tarot.R:** Inspired by listening to a lot of TTRPG podcasts. Simulate a deck of cards to draw from, then, as a later extension, use a tarot deck instead of a standard card deck.
* **vcf to csv.R:** One of my friends asked me how to export her phone contacts to Excel. There are some existing options, but it got me curious, and it turns out a .vcf is basically just a text file? And I was bored. So I made my own solution. It's not perfect, but it does what I wanted.
* **full name to first last.R:** Take a list of names and output the same list into a consistent "Last, First" format.
