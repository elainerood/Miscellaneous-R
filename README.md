# Miscellaneous R code
Random functions/code that isn't (yet?) part of a larger project. Updated as I come up with things.

Contents:
* **draw_cards.R** and **draw_tarot.R:** Inspired by listening to a lot of TTRPG podcasts, simulate a deck of cards to draw from. As a later extension, use a tarot deck instead of a standard card deck.
* **Full name to first last.R:** 8/8/19. Take a list of names and output the same list into a consistent "First, Last" format.
