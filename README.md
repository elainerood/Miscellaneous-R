# Miscellaneous R code
Random functions/code that isn't (yet?) part of a larger project. Updated as I come up with things. Bear with me as I figure out how to use GitHub instead of just local version control :)

Contents (mostly chonological):
* **draw_cards.R** and **draw_tarot.R:** 10/26/18 (upd 1/20/19) and 3/23/19. Inspired by listening to a lot of TTRPG podcasts, simulate a deck of cards to draw from. As a later extension, use a tarot deck instead of a standard card deck.
* **vcf to csv.R:** Late December 2018 (upd 2/6/19). One of my friends asked me how to export her phone contacts to Excel. There are some options, but it got me curious, and it turns out a .vcf is basically just a text file? And I was bored. So I made my own option. It's not perfect, but it does what I wanted.
* **full name to first last.R:** 8/8/19. Take a list of names and output the same list into a consistent "First, Last" format.
